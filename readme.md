# Main objectives

I created these projects to pratice in certain areas like API calls and developing an UI.

## Wallpaper

This project uses an API key from Wallhaven to grab images and then apply it to your desktop. Currently it pulls the trending image of the day. I am currently working on a search function to query or themes for certain images.

## WeatherAPI

This one uses an API for https://api.weather.gov to get local weather data. While this works, the location data is hard coded into the script. Next steps are to build out a reverse geocoding process to enter in a location to get the weather data of that place.
